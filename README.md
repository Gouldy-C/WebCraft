# WebCraft 🎮

A Minecraft-inspired voxel game engine built with TypeScript and Three.js, featuring procedural terrain generation and efficient chunk management.

## 🌟 Features

- **Procedural World Generation**: Dynamic terrain generation using Simplex noise
- **Chunk-based World Management**: Efficient rendering using a chunk-based system
- **Multi-threaded Performance**: Web Workers for non-blocking chunk generation
- **Modern 3D Graphics**: Powered by Three.js with fog and shadow effects
- **Physics System**: Basic physics implementation for player movement
- **Optimized Rendering**: Draw distance management and fog for performance
- **Interactive Controls**: Player movement and world interaction

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
